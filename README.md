### PROJECT DESCRIPTION/OUTLINE:  

-Calculate average changes in salary over time by country (top 5 volume?) (low 5 volume?) and overall experience level required (top 5 volume?)
-Create line graph for visualization (1,2)
-Create pie graph for visualization (3)

-Calculate summary statistics on salary (USD) by job title (top 5 volume?) and experience level (all?)
-Create boxplots for visualization (4,5)

-Identify location of workers for US companies and location of companies for US workers
-create geomaps for visualization (s=volume) (6,7)

### RESEARCH QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:

1. How have data science salaries changed over time?
2. What is the breakdown of experience level required?
3. How do data science salaries vary by job title and experience?
4. Do US companies hire US residents and do US residents work for US companies?
